# Foodora Fleet Demo by Dania Sami

If you are reviewing this project, then great news  
You are about to see exactly why I will be a strong addition to your team.

I built this demo specifically for the Foodora Fleet Associate role.  
Not because anyone asked me to, but because I believe in showing real work.  

I prefer to demonstrate what I *actually* do.

This small project is only the beginning.  
Give me real workflows, real tools, and real responsibilities  
and I will build systems that make the team faster, sharper, and more efficient from day one.

# What this demo showcases

I created a mini version of an operational payout oversight tool.  
It simulates real fleet scenarios where accuracy, attention to detail, and structured follow up matter.

The demo  
loads rider data  
runs checks  
detects issues  
and builds follow up actions  
in a clean and simple format.

This reflects exactly how I approach real work  
fast  
structured  
and always focused on clarity.
