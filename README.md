# Gen Pink Lab

Welcome and thank you for checking out my work.

I’m Dania, an engineer who learns fast, builds fast, and fixes problems even faster.  
I’ve led AWS cloud workshops, managed technical communities, and driven projects where speed, ownership, and clarity mattered every day.

If you're here to evaluate my abilities, this lab makes it simple  everything I build is practical, clean, and designed to solve real operational challenges. 

Give me a problem and I’ll give you a solution.  
Give me a team and I’ll elevate it.  
Give me a chance and I’ll prove why you needed me all along.

This space will grow with new demos, operational tools, and experiments  all built with purpose, precision, and a little Gen Pink spirit.
